# Weather App

## About

### This is an application that displays the current and 5 day weather forecast using fetch API's. All you have to do is enter in a city name and the application will populate the informtation for you!

## Journey

## This was a failry difficult application to create and even though it is not 100% finished yet, I believe that it still works faily well. Working through the API call inside the console was a challenge but I was able to push through and make it work.
